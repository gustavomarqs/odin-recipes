        <h3>This drink combines cocoa powder, milk, and heavy cream for a delicious result! The touch of cinnamon adds a unique flavor that makes your hot chocolate even tastier. The trick to making the drink very creamy is the presence of cornstarch. When added in the right amount, it makes the hot chocolate thicker without altering the flavor.</h3>
